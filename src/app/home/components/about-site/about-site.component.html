<h3><a id="Motivation_1"></a>Motivation</h3>
<p>The point of making this site is to explore new engineering practices, and because I wanted to gain more experience
  in responsive web design as well as set up a CI/CD pipeline.</p>
<h3><a id="Technologies_4"></a>Technologies</h3>
<p>The site is made with <em>Angular</em> and uses all custom components I’ve created except for the <em>Bootstrap</em>
  navbar (and layout/grid). The Git repository is hosted by <em>Bitbucket</em> where all of my source code is public and
  available for <a href="https://bitbucket.org/rschuckit">viewing</a>, and I make use of their integrated pipeline
  functionality. The build is run in a <em>Docker</em> container and is deployed to <em>Firebase Hosting</em>. Their is
  test coverage, and a merge to master with all passing tests triggers a deployment to production. This documentation is
  generated from a Markdown file I wrote and is translated to HTML. I go into full details below.</p>
<h3><a id="CICD_Pipeline_7"></a>CI/CD Pipeline</h3>
<p>One of the driving motivations for this site was to setup a CI/CD pipeline. I chose to make use of Bitbucket’s
  pipeline solution. When a commit is pushed, the tests are run to determine if the build is successful or not. When a
  commit is merged into master, the tests are run and a deployment is started.</p>
