  <h3><a id="Motivation_1"></a>Motivation</h3>
  <p>The point of making this site is to explore new engineering practices, and because I wanted to gain more experience
    in responsive web design as well as set up a CI/CD pipeline.</p>
  <h3><a id="Technologies_4"></a>Technologies</h3>
  <p>The site is made with <strong>Angular</strong> and uses all custom components Iâ€™ve created except for the <strong>Bootstrap</strong>
    navbar (and layout/grid). The Git repository is hosted by <strong>Bitbucket</strong> where all of my source code is
    public and available for viewing, and I make use of their integrated pipeline functionality. The build is run in a
    custom <strong>Docker</strong> container I made and is deployed to <strong>Firebase Hosting</strong>. There is full
    test coverage, and a merge to master with all passing tests triggers a deployment to "production." This
    documentation is stored in and generated from a Markdown file I wrote and is translated to HTML using the open
    source library <strong>Showdown</strong>. I go into full details below.</p>
