This is my personal website written in Augular. I built it as a playground for various web technologies
and techniques. It makes use of GitHub Actions for CI/CD (formerly hosted on Bitbucket 
with their built in pipelines functionality). I go into some detail on how I built it at 
https://aboutruben.com/about-site.
